This document serves to document changes to the Mozilla source code.

Favor C99 features in C based code.
- e.g. Overhaul to LONG LONG to use uint64_t
- Replace PL_snprintf with snprintf (C99 feature)

C++

object fields to 0.

On Windows, __declspec(thread) doesn't exist for Mingw. So change to just __thread
